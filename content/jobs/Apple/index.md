- Collaborated with Indiana Soybean Alliance to craft an all-encompassing platform in Python and ReactJS that fetches various programs through online sources to be a one-stop-place for all farmers across the state of Indiana and beyond.
- Researched over 5+ million acres of geo-spatial data to scrape onto a SQL database and analyzed aspects of data with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 API such as crop type, price, county, and forms required to determine effective locations of programs.
- Synchronized those programs with the backend part of the application using Pandas, Django, and Splite.
