- Conducted research in the Data Fusion Lab on localization algorithms for cells to determine their health conditions.
- Developed an automatic cell tracking algorithm in Python that achieved 90% accuracy for detection and data visualization.
- Minimized spurious detections by 75% through employing Gaussian filters and Otsuâ€™s method for intensity thresholding.
- Increased code usability through reimplementing codebase on specimen collection from MATLAB to Python by producing ~1000 lines of code that performed the computational CASA model with minimal user intervention.
